# Code Cards

Code Cards is a web-app built to help developers share their software projects in real life. Developers are asked all the time, "So what are you working on?". This can be a precarious position as explaining to the non-technical on-demand can be a bit tricky because projects can be quite complex even for the developers who work on them, and abstracting away from complexity to understandable terms can take some real thinking. Code Cards is here to help!

Find some projects you would like to be able to explain better and fill our simple form. Think of a presentation note cards from school that helped ease that stressful process, letting us remember things we might other wise forget or help explain something with analogies and the like.

After creation of the card you can either share the link with others or bring it up on your mobile device to use. Sign in with Google or GitHub and get started today!
